this is a reimplementation of [1]. as such, please refer to the README therein for the motivation of the implementation.
this code is motivated by the need to apply the algorithm on a 3- or 4-dimensional template, which is not supported by [1].
the implementation provided here is the general N-dimensional case, although this is ultimately limited by the available simulation statistics.
