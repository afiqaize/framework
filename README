analysis framework builder for use in typical HEP analyses

requirements
- C++17 compiler: development and testing are done with gcc 8.3.1
- ROOT: no explicit requirement, but development and testing are done with ROOT 6.18.04
- for CMS members, the environment provided by CMSSW_11_0_X and newer fulfills the requirements
- the framework itself is independent of CMSSW however
- headers in plugins may introduce additional dependencies

quickstart
- check the exec/example_gen_ttbar.cc annotated example file

notes
- only flat ROOT trees are supported, where flat means the branches are either simple types e.g. ints, floats, bools or arrays of those
- the core part of the framework is only a set of headers to be compiled together with user's execution macro
- the execution macro is a set of instructions provided by the user according to their analysis needs, which also doubles as the configuration

directories
- src: the core part of the framework
- exec: contains an annotated execution macro to illustrate the use of the framework, plus others the author is working on
- plugins: additional header files that are not considered as part of framework core, but can be convenient for more complex analyses

planned improvements
- plugin for prescaled triggers
- plotting and other histogram manipulation plugin
- datacard plugin for use with Higgs combine tool
- support for other output formats e.g. json, csv
- interface for keeping track of group summary statistics
- concurrency support

feedback and/or bug report are welcome
